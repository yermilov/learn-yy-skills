/**
 * audit-frontmatter — the mechanical half of a skill-authoring review (§1).
 *
 * Parses every SKILL.md frontmatter as YAML (never a `description:` line-grep, which bleeds into the
 * keys that follow and over-reports length) and reports, per skill:
 *   - description length in CODE POINTS against the 1024-character cap (the skill validator refuses
 *     a longer one; the runtime accepts it and truncates the tail, where the boundary lives)
 *   - whether the DESCRIPTION carries a `Do not use for…` boundary — read off the parsed field, not
 *     the file, because the same phrase in the body is not a boundary
 *   - `name` vs its directory
 *   - frontmatter that will not parse at all — which is counted in NONE of the other buckets, so it
 *     is announced up front rather than only at the end
 *
 * The boundary regex is a SHORTLIST, not a verdict: real boundaries phrase themselves freely
 * ("Do NOT use it to…", "— that's <sibling>"), so read what it flags before believing it.
